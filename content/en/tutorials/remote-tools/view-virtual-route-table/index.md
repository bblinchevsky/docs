## Analyzing the Route Table

### Route Availability

If a route is available, its `Active` column will show a green up arrow (<i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up" style="color: green;"></i>). If a route is not available, its `Active` column will show a red down arrow (<i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down" style="color: red;"></i>).

### Route Preference

Routes will be selected based on the following order:

1. In overlapping routes, the most specific route wins. For example, 10.20.0.51/32 takes precedence over 10.20.0.0/24.
1. If multiple matching routes exist, the route with the lowest metric wins. For example, a metric of 1 takes precedence over a metric of 50.
